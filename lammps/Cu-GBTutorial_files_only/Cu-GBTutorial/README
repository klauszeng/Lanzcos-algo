This tutorial compares the grain-boundary behavior of Cu Sigma5 (310)  tilt grain boundary for three different potentials (EAM,COM,LJ).

To see the effect the effect of temperature variable tmp can be varied and the potential energy profile throughout the grain-boundary structure can be seen.


The .cfg files can be visualized/animated using atomeye software.(See atomeye manual how to generate movie).
